# mfca-knime-extension
Material Flow Cost Accounting (MFCA) originated in Germany in the 1990s as a management tool that examines the environmental impact and cost of resource flows in production processes. It aims to reduce resource usage, save production costs, and minimize unnecessary waste by analyzing inputs and outputs. In 2011, it became an international standard (ISO 14051) after gaining widespread adoption in Japan. MFCA quantifies process outputs in monetary terms to identify improvement and cost reduction areas, making it a powerful tool for organizations to balance economic and environmental considerations while promoting green supply chains and products.

Calculating material cost accounting can be difficult, and appropriate software tools are currently lacking. Manufacturing processes vary greatly, and having a standard information system covering all calculations is difficult.

With over 20 years of experience in Java programming and a deep understanding of manufacturing processes, I have found the KNIME Analytics Platform to be an invaluable tool for implementing MFCA. Its visualized operation interface simplifies the reflection of the manufacturing process in a KNIME workflow, making it a straightforward task. Leveraging my expertise, I have created a series of MFCA KNIME NODE to promote material flow cost accounting, confident in the platform's ability to support this important aspect of manufacturing management.

## Installation

Find the latest version of KNIME Analytics Platform from [KNIME Analytics Platform 5.3](https://www.knime.com/downloads)

To get started with the MFCA extension for KNIME, download the JAR file (org.greenopendata_1.0.X.jar) from the latest release. Once downloaded, copy the JAR file into the [KNIME Folder]\dropins folder, such as c:\knime_5.3.1\dropins.

Copy the JAR file into the folder [KNIME Folder]\dropins, such as c:\knime_5.3.1\dropins.

Start the KNIME (knime.exe), and you can find the Quantity Center node in the Node Repository.
